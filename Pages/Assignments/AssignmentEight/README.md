# Dynamic Multiplication Table

This was the final part of a series of assignments that started with using
plain old javascript to create a multiplication table. Next part of the assignment
had us using JQuery validation to validate the input given to the table. Finally
we added JQuery UI to include sliders, tabs, and two-way binding between the sliders and
input fields.<br/>

I had a lot of fun with this assignment and it was a good way to learn how to use JQuery.
