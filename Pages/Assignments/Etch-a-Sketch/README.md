### Etch-a-Sketch

I completed this project as part of www.theodinproject.com Web Development 101 online course
that I did over the summer in my spare time. <br/>

In this course I learned many basic skills needed for web development, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This project was a way for me to mix together all the elements I had learned in the course, and
also to get a little creative and have some fun. <br/>

Shortly after completing this project my fall semester started where I did a Front End Web development 
class were I learned a lot more about web development.
